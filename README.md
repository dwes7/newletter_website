# newletter_website
This is my personal newsletter website project. There are lots of examples of these on the web, and this is my personal implementation using tool that I currently learning about. The site will request users to input their name and mailing info, and post changes to a Mailchimp account using Mailchimp's API. I'll try to make the website, somewhat generic and include some instructions on how to set it up for your own purposes.

# Tools Used
- Javascript
- bootstrap
- express
- node.js

A lot of these tools are new to me so if there are any tips on how to better utilize them or simplify the work, please feel free to comment. For reference, how to build this project is tought throught the Udemy course [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) 

## My plan
My plan is to utilize this simple newsletter sign up to my personal website that I have yet to create. So stay tuned...
